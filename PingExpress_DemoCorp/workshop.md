# Workshop sheet: Building a Sample Data-Intensive Application with TiDB Cloud
In this workshop, we will build a data-intensive application with TiDB cloud and Metabase. We will show you how TiDB cloud enables real-time insights.

## Disclaimer
- PingExpress_DemoCorp is a dummy company. It does NOT reflect or imply any real company.
- This workshop  is for demonstration purposes only. Do NOT use any material (including but not limited to code, and commands) from this tutorial in production environments.

## Before You Begin
You should have the following software and packages installed: 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v. 3+)
- [MySQL connector for Python](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-python)
- [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy)
- [sqlalchemy-tidb](https://github.com/pingcap/sqlalchemy-tidb)
- [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/operations-guide/installing-metabase.html)

Note: It is recommended to use pip3 to install packages, such as SQLAlchemy. We also suggest NOT to use the Mac application version for Metabase. It is gradually being phased out. We recommend you run Metabase on [Heroku](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/operations-guide/running-metabase-on-heroku.html). You may also use the jar version for Metabase.

## Task 1: Create a TiDB Developer Tier cluster (10 minutes)
1. If you do not have a TiDB Cloud account, click [here](https://tidbcloud.com/free-trial) to sign up for an account.
2. [Log in](https://tidbcloud.com/) to your TiDB Cloud account.
3. Click **Create a Cluster**. 
4. Click **Developer Tier**.
5. On the **Create a Cluster (Dev Tier)** page, set up **Cluster Name** and **Root Password**. (In this tutorial, we will call our cluster **PingExpressDB**).
6. Choose a **US-West-2 (Oregon)** as your **Region**. 
7. Click **Create**.

Your TiDB Cloud cluster will be created in approximately 5 to 10 minutes.

## Task 2: Connect to TiDB Cloud (5 minutes)
1. On the TiDB Cloud console, click **PingExpressDB**.
2. In the upper right of the pane, click **Connect**. The **Connect to TiDB** dialog displays.
3. Create the traffic filter for the cluster.
   - Click **Allow Access from Anywhere** in Step 1.
   - Click **Create Filter**.
  Note: For production environments, do not enable **Allow Access from Anywhere**.
4. Note the information between the -h and -P parameters; you'll need this for a later step, as you will use it at a later step. For example:  *mysql -u root -h tidb.xxx.xxxxx.us-west-2.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com -P 4000 -p*
5. Open a terminal, and type in the command provided to connect to your cluster. (You may also use WebSQL Shell.)

## Task 3: Import the sample data (10 minutes)
Write SQL commands in your terminal.
1. Create a database.
   ~~~
   CREATE DATABASE PingExpressDB;
   ~~~
2. Create a user of the database. The user name is *'PingExpress_client'*, and you should set your own password to replace *'\<pwd\>'*, such as *'123'*.
   ~~~   
   CREATE USER 'PingExpress_client' IDENTIFIED BY '<pwd>';
   ~~~
3. Grant all privileges to the user you just created.
   ~~~
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON PingExpressDB.* TO 'PingExpress_client';
   ~~~
4. Navigate to the TiDB Cloud Clusters page and find your dev cluster.
5. In the upper right corner of the pane, click **Import**. The **Data Import Task** page is displayed.
6. Enter the following information, and click **Import** to import the sample data: 	
   - Data Source Type: Select **AWS S3**
   - Bucket URL: 
      ~~~
      s3://pingexpress-na/data_workshop/
      ~~~
   - Bucket Region: **US West (Oregon)**
   - Data Format: **Select TiDB Dumpling**
   - Setup the following credentials for Role ARN: 
      ~~~
      arn:aws:iam::577523860935:role/pingexpress-na
      ~~~
   - Target Database:
      - Username: root.
      - Password: Enter your root password.
   - DB/Tables Filter: Leave this field blank.
   - The data import process takes about 5 minutes. When the data import progress bar shows **Success**, you have successfully imported the sample data and the database schema in your database. 

7. Check the imported data.
Open your terminal which is connected to TiDB Cloud.
   - Switch to PingExpressDB. 
      ~~~
      USE PingExpressDB;
      ~~~
   - Check the number of records. The result should be 762000. 
      ~~~
      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM packages;
      ~~~

8. Create TiFlash replicas for the table packages.
   ~~~
   ALTER TABLE packages SET TiFlash REPLICA 1;
   ~~~
   Wait for a few minutes and then run the following query to check whether the TiFlash node is ready.
   ~~~
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.TIFLASH_REPLICA;
   ~~~
   When the TiFlash node is ready, the values of the “AVAILABLE” and “PROGRESS” columns turn to 1.

## Task 4: Connect to TiDB Cloud via Metabase (10 minutes)
In this section, we walk you through the process of connecting to TiDB Cloud via Metabase. For more information, see [How to Connect TiDB Cloud to Metabase](https://en.pingcap.com/blog/how-to-connect-tidb-cloud-to-metabase).

1. Start the Metabase application and click **Let’s get started**.
2. Select your preferred language and click **Next**. 
3. Enter your information and account details in Step 2 and click **Next**.
4. In the **Add your data** step, click the **Database type** drop down menu and select **MySQL**.
5. Specify the following settings
   - Name: PingExpressDB
   - Host: <your_tidb_cloud_ip_address_obtained_previously>.
   - Port: 4000
   - Database name: PingExpressDB
   - Username: root
   - Password: <password_of_your_tidb_cluster>
6. Scroll down to the bottom and click **Next**.
7. For the Usage data preference step, change your preference if needed and click **Next**. 
8. Click **Take me to Metabase**.

## Task 5: Build your dashboards in Metabase (10 minutes)
1. Create a dashboard.
   In the top right corner of the dashboard, click the **+** sign, and then choose **New Dashboard**. 
   1. Enter the name as *PingExpress_dashboard*.
   2. Click **Create**.
   3. Click **Save**.
2. Add a question.
   1. In the top right corner of the dashboard, click the **+** sign, and then choose **SQL Query**.
   2. Select **PingExpressDB** as the database. 
   3. Find the number of packages in processing. Enter the following query:
      ~~~
      SELECT courier, count(*) AS numPackages
      FROM packages
      WHERE transaction_kind != '4_pkg_out'
      GROUP BY courier
      ORDER BY count(*) DESC;
      ~~~
      Click Run
   4. After getting the result, click the **Visualization** button, and then choose **Table**.
   5. Click Conditional Formatting.
      - Click **Add a rule**
      - Choose **numPackages**
   6. In **When a cell in this column…** choose **is greater than**
   7. Enter number *115,000*
   8. Choose your favorite background color.
3. Save the question.
   1. In the upper right corner, click **Save**.
   2. Enter the name *Number of Packages in Processing*. 
   3. When being asked if you would like to add this question to the dashboard, click **Yes please!**, and choose **PingExpress_dashboard**. 
   4. The result will now appear on the dashboard.
   5. Click Save. 
4. Navigate to the clock button on the upper right corner, and set auto-refresh as 1 minute.

## Task 6: Execute the program (10 minutes)
1. Clone the program to your local machine, or any virtual machines provided by your cloud vendor.
   ~~~
   git clone https://github.com/pingcap/education.git
   ~~~
2. Go to the directory for **PingExpress_DemoCorp**.
   ~~~
   cd education/PingExpress_DemoCorp
   ~~~
3. Compose your connection string. The connection string is in the following format. You can find the host address for TiDB Cloud in Connect to TiDB - Standard Connection - Step 2 in the TiDB Console, in the format: *xxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com.*  
   ~~~
   tidb://<client_name>:<pwd>@<host-address>:4000/<DB_name>
   ~~~
   For example, if the client name is PingExpress_client, the password is 123, and the database name is PingExpressDB, the connection string is:
   ~~~
   tidb://PingExpress_client:123@xxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com:4000/PingExpressDB
   ~~~

4. Execute the program. Enter
   ~~~
   python3 PingExpress_client_workshop.py --execute --clients 50 --duration 200 --connection_string <your-connection-string>
   ~~~
   The command assumes there will be 50 clients, and the program runs for 200 seconds. Note: For TiDB Cloud Developer Tier, the maximum number of connections allowed is 50.

6. Observe the results. When the program starts running, you can navigate to the Metabase dashboard and observe the dashboard being updated in real time.
